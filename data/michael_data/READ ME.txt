THINGS TO NOTE
______________

1. Putty only logs when serial connection is established. That means that it's pretty much impossible to get a 
timestamp that starts at 0 as I need to click and open and stuff. This means that some data sets start at 3000 and others at 5000.

2. I tried to standardize the data set. The walking and stair ascent has the same leg movement for each type respectivley.

3. I started my actual movement at Timesatmp 10000 for each data set. The rest before 10000 is just idoling for cropping later.
